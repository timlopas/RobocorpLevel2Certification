# RobocorpLevel2Certification
Robocorp level II certification course submission

This is my submission for the Robocorp Level II Certification. This bot uses the https://robotsparebinindustries.com/ website as provided by Robocorp for use to learn and test their software.

This bot will present the user with a menu in which they can either choose to execute Maria's weekly copy and paste task (as written and defined in the Robocorp Level I Certification) or the user can choose to place orders for Robots based on a CSV file that contains the order requests.

Thank you for looking at my solution and have a great day.

-Tim
