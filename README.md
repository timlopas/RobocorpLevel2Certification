# RobocorpLevel2Certification
Robocorp level II certification course submission

This is my submission for the Robocorp Level II Certification. This bot uses the https://robotsparebinindustries.com/ website as provided by Robocorp for use to learn and test their software.

This bot will present the user with a menu in which they can either choose to execute Maria's weekly copy and paste task (as written and defined in the Robocorp Level I Certification) or the user can choose to place orders for Robots based on a CSV file that contains the order requests.

To execute this code please download the latest release and unzip the folder in the location of yoru choice. Once completed you can open Robocorp Lab, Visual Studio, or RCC and point to the newly umpackaged folder. From there you can execute as you would any other robot in an IDE or from the RCC prompt.

Thank you for looking at my solution and have a great day.

-Tim
